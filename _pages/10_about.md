Grah Ayurveda is a supplier for DwaarPe, the home-based services division of DKOP Labs.

We make Ayurveda and herbal/natural cosmetics, for the face and body. Our patrons (Nidhi and Manu) have guided us in setting up this micro-business, and have provided us with steady business from DwaarPe (DKOP). They also guide us in improving our products, work with us to create new formulations, sourcing new suppliers for the ingredients, and connect us with the various experts in this field.

We need your support and business. You could help by
1. Suggesting new product formulations
2. Buying DwaarPe products
